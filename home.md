# About Me

Hey everyone! My name is **Ashenafee**, but most of you probably know me as **Ash**. I'm currently in my **third year** studying Bioinformatics, Neuroscience, and CS.

In recent times I have been **tuning in** more and more with my **background** by attending BSA events and making new **black friends**.

This **feeling**, this **warmth** is one I want to help create which is why I'm running to be your **Educational & Outreach Director** for the 2023 - 2024 BSA Team.

For more information about my campaign, please visit my Instagram page:

If you have any questions, comments, and/or concerns, feel free to message me on Instagram as well.
