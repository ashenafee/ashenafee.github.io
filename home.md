Hello, my name is Ashenafee Mandefro and I'm a fourth-year student at the University of Toronto! I'm currently studying:

- Bioinformatics & Computational Biology Specialist
- Neuroscience Major
- Computer Science Major

In addition to my studies, I'm also a video game developer in the Pardee Lab working on a molecular biology educational game, as well as a Senior Peer Mentor working with the FAS - the largest faculty in North America. If you're curious about my academic and professional background, you can find my resume [here](https://www.ashenafee.com/resume.pdf).

Below are some of the projects I've worked on recently. Feel free to connect with me on any of my platforms :)
